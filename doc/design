lcdTerminal design
==================

Hardware:
=========

  LCD display 4 lines x 20 characters
  Arduino nano
  Contrast potentionemeter (47k)
  Backlight resistor (47R)

  Connections between LCD and Arduino:
    LCD                     Arduino
    1  VSS                  GND
    2  VDD                  5v
    4  RS                   D2
    5  R/W                  D3
    6  E                    D4
    7  DB0                  D5
    8  DB1                  D6
    9  DB2                  D7
    10 DB3                  D8
    11 DB4                  D9
    12 DB5                  D10
    13 DB6                  D11
    14 DB7                  D12

    Other LCD connections:
    3  VO                   wiper of potentiometer 47k between 5v and gnd
    15 + backlight          5V via 47R (possibly switched for variable brightnes
    16 - backlight          GND

  These connections allow the arduino to be connected directly to pins 4..14 of the LCD module.
  The other pins are brought out by flying leads to veroboard.

Software:
=========

  Use "LiquidCrystal" library for display
  Store 4 lines of 20 characters to allow scrolling

  See the .ino file for details of control character sequences.
